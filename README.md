# Trello

This project is dedicated to the QA assignment given by Trello Team.

#### Assignment

- Create UI tests 
- Use Selenium and Junit

#### Solution

Test will be located in src/main/java/LoginTest directory

To run these test we should right-click on the LoginTest class and then run these Test.
Or we could Edit configuration and choose which test to run.
This is possible by jUnit.
The LoginTest file contains two test cases.
The first test is for login and logout.
The second test creates a board, verifies that it was created and then deletes it.

#### Improvements

We could add BDD - Cucumber for feature file, then add 3 other layes such as stepDef, step, and unit layer,
I could add an Enum class for selectors
