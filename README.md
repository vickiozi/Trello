This project is dedicated to the QA assignment given by Trello Team.

#### Assignment

- Create UI tests 
- Use Selenium and Junit

#### Solution

Test will be located in src/main/java/LoginTest directory

To run these test we should right-click on the LoginTest class and then run these Test.
Or we could Edit configuration and choose which test to run
This is possible by jUnit.


#### Improvements

We could add BDD - Cucumber for feature file, then add 3 other layes such as stepDef, step, and unit layer,
I could add an Enum class for selectors
